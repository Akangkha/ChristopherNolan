        Best known for his cerebral, often nonlinear, storytelling, acclaimed writer-director Christopher Nolan was born on July 30, 1970, in London, England. Nolan has gone from low-budget independent films to working on some of the biggest blockbusters ever made.  At 7 years old, Nolan began making short movies with his father's Super-8 camera.
        Christopher Nolan has a set style of directing which we see echoed throughout his films. The films are filled with ambiguity and unease, which are partially transmitted through journeys of identity construction and endings. We get the recurring central question of hero or antihero.The antagonist and protagonist in Nolanâ€™s films are mostly mirror images of each other. Nolan is known to create great juxta positioning, especially in showing good vs. evil.He is one of the highest-grossing directors in history, and among the most acclaimed and influential filmmakers of the 21st century.
